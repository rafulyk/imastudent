  <ul>

    <li><h3>Lips as the source of vibration: </h3><p>The musician presses the mouthpiece to their lips and blows air, causing the lips to vibrate. This vibration is called the embouchure. The pitch of the produced sound (or, more precisely, the overtone) depends on the tension of the lip muscles. The tighter they are, the higher the frequency of the vibrations and, consequently, the higher the resulting overtone.</p></li>

    <li><h3>Resonance in the instrument: </h3><p>The lip vibration is transferred to the air column inside the instrument. The air resonates, amplifying the sound. The fundamental (lowest) note that can be played depends on the total length of the instrument's tubing.</p>
</li>

    <li><h3>Changing the length of the tubing: </h3><p>To create different notes within one overtone (and to play a chromatic scale), a mechanism is used to change the total length of the air column: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><h4>Valves: </h4><p>By pressing the valves (pistons or rotary), the musician adds or removes additional sections of tubing (crooks) from the main airflow. This changes the total path length the air travels, which in turn changes the pitch.</p>
</li>
        <li><h4>Slide: </h4><p>Trombones use a slideâ€”a telescoping tube. By moving it, the musician smoothly changes the length of the instrument and, as a result, the pitch.</p>
